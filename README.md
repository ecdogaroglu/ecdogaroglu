I had a rather unorthodox start to coding. After being mesmerized by data sculptures of Refik Anadol, I had to learn the technology behind; which led me to take Interactive Arts & Algorithmic Design classes during my bachelor's. There I became accustomed to software like Processing (Java based) and Touchdesigner (Python based ), where I built a graphical real-time tuner that can identify multiple frequencies in sound using Fourier transformation.

Later, during my professional life, I have utilized the power of automation and natural language processing to take the game to the next level.

My latest projects include computational adaptation of game theoretical models with a high focus on good software engineering practices and reproducibility.
