I share my research utilitizing game theory, stochastic processes, dynamic programming, graph theory, reinforcement learning and neural networks. Currently, I am working on my thesis titled "Social Learning via Multi Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning" to provide solutions for microeconomic theory models with the help of machine learning.
